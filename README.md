Kagamin is a hard-working, tsundere Slack bot. Probably someone's waifu, but it's not because she likes them or anything.

To unbreak the build, create a `KagaInfo` module with two exported functions:
`kagaToken :: String`, containing your bot's Slack API token; and
`kagaID :: Text`, containing your bot's ID on the form "<@XXXXXXXXX>".
